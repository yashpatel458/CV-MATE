# CV-Mate

Our main aim is to design an program which will screen all the resumes according to the job description and provide us useful data which will be visualized with the use of data visualization tools. This will significantly reduce the processing time and make recruitment process much easier. 

In order to solve this issue, We will be using Natural Language Processing (NLP) for phrasing through the resume and extracting text through PyPDF Python library.

Further, in order to visualise the processed data we will be using matplotlib which is a python library for data visualisation.
